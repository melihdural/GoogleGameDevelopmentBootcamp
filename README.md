Two Shader Graphs were created for Planets and Meteor Trail Effect,

Created a UI that opens when pressing the planets and writes the names of the planets, Adjusted to close when the cross icon is pressed,

A meteor system has been created that spawns in random positions and moves towards a random planet, creates a trail effect behind it as it moves, and gives an explosion particle effect when it hits the planet,

A system has been created for the camera, in which the camera can rotate clockwise after being idle for 3 seconds, stop when the planets are clicked, continue when the UI window is closed, and the user can move himself with the help of his mouse if he wants.
